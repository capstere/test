        <p class="title"><strong>RETURN OF THE JESP</strong></p>
<p>The Jedi Knight known only as JESP has been summoned back from self-imposed exile by the FIRST ORDER.</p>
<p>After vanishing without a trace, JESP was secretly captured by the sinister GURULAB.</p>
<p>The once-promising Jedi has now escaped and returned to his home planet of BROWSKIS.</p>
<p>There, alongside the fierce Jedi Knights vdao and ELS, young JESP must once again board the</p>
<p>Milliliter FALCON Tube, a vessel fully equipped for the mission ahead. Unfortunately, JESP is not.</p>
<p>He has no plan, no understanding of the objective, and continues to confuse hyperspace with emotional growth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, SENATOR TUKA, obsessed with locating JESP, has dispatched thousands of remote probes into the far reaches of space.</p>
<p>Not to rescue him - but to uncover the full extent of his ignorance.</p>
<p>Unaware of the trials to come, JESP must now UNLEARN all that he once tried to learn.</p>
<p>The fate of the galaxy may hang in the balance… but mostly, everyone just wants to know how he made it this far.</p>
